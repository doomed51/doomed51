### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I build primarily in Python. 

### I am actively working on two projects: 
- [analysis](https://github.com/doomed51/analysis): collection of scripts to analyze various financial market data (e.g. vix term structure, seasonality patterns, etc.)
- [saveHistoricalData](https://github.com/doomed51/saveHistoricalData): maintains a local database of timeseries data for securities

### About Me
I first started coding QBASIC in high school, followed by c++. My first 'app' was a space invaders clone (the aliens were headcrabs from Half Life) built in VB6. I have an engineering degree that taught me stats, work experience that taught me people, and a penchant for getting myself into interesting problems.

I write a [newletter](https://crossedwires.substack.com/). And I am fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/inSenCite) if you want to get in touch.
