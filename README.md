### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I build statistical tools to make better financial decisions. 

### Active projects: 
- [analysis](https://github.com/doomed51/analysis): Time series analysis tools and utilities:  momentum, volatility mean reversion, seasonality , and futures term structure construction.
- [saveHistoricalData](https://github.com/doomed51/saveHistoricalData): Retrieve and store time-series data for equities and futures.

### About Me
I enjoy applying stats to financial markets. 

I write a [newletter](https://crossedwires.substack.com/). And I am fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/inSenCite).
