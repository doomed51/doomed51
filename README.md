### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I build primarily in Pyhon. 

### I am actively working on two projects: 
- analysis: collection of scripts to analyze various financial market data 
- saveHistoricalData: maintains a local database of timeseries data for securities

### About Me
I first started coding QBASIC in high school, followed by c++. My first 'app' was a space invaders clone (the aliens were headcrabs from Half Life) built in c++. I have an engineering degree from the University of Waterloo specialized in operations research, org design, and business. My current work is focused on financial markets. 

I write a [newletter](https://crossedwires.substack.com/). And I am fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/inSenCite) if you want to get in touch.
