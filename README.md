### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I build statistical tools to make better financial decisions. 

### Active projects: 
- [analysis](https://github.com/doomed51/analysis): A comprehensive set of scripts for various financial analyses and market monitoring, including momentum strategies, volatility mean reversion, seasonality patterns, and futures term structure assessments.
- [saveHistoricalData](https://github.com/doomed51/saveHistoricalData): A robust data pipeline designed for the ingestion, cleaning, and storage of time-series data for equities and futures markets.

### About Me
I enjoy applying stats to real life. 

I write a [newletter](https://crossedwires.substack.com/). And I am fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/inSenCite).
